I've probably deployed applications _thousands_ of times with Elasticbeanstalk. But recently I came across a really strange error:


```
ERROR: InvalidParameterValueError - Invalid unicode xml character in CreateApplicationVersionMessage.Description at index 53
```

I switched from my feature branch back to `master` and `eb deploy`'d and it worked as expected.

I thought maybe my feature branch name was the problem, so I `git checkout -b feature/new-name` to try to see if there were special characters causing the issue but no luck.

## The Fix

Some report that deleting your Application Versions in the ElasticBeanstalk console will do the trick. I deleted all Application Versions and I was still not able to deploy it.

What worked for me was to utilize the `--message=` option in the `eb deploy` command.

So utilize this to override the autogenerated `CreateApplicationVersionMessage.Description` during the vanill `eb deploy` command:

```
  eb deploy --message="test"
```

Now `"test"` overrides the problem autogenerated vaue and it fixed the issue for me. Happy building.
