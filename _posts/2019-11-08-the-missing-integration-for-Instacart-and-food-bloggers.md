title: Future thoughts: Instacart/Amazon Fresh + an API + Food Bloggers
category: personal
---

This is just another business idea post.

The idea is that Instacart & Amazon Fresh already provide the grocery delivering experience. However, the missing link is the ability to port a receipe you find online directly into your online shopping cart.

As a consumer, I enjoy food blogs because they provide easy to follow reciepes.

I also enjoy Instacart for the ability to shop for these ingredients and have them delivered to my home.

## Here's where the friction is

The issue is you can't directly purchase the ingredients for a given reciepe with 1 click. You have to switch between tabs and search for each ingredient individually. It's a total pain.

I just want to be able to click 1 button "Buy on Instacart" and have these items added to my Instacart shopping cart.

## Bonus round: Affiliate Network

So the incentives are clear for both the consumer and Instacart, but why would a food blogger want to go through the hassle of Instacart-ifying all their receipes?

The answer is affiliate links. If the bloggers were given commission for each line item sale, their incentives would be aligned with Instacart and the customer.

## So make it happen Dylan!

So the major component that's necessary to make this idea a reality is a grocery store API to integrate with.

Problem is, we're just not there yet. Instacart seems to have one of the most robust grocery store system around, they cover a plethora of stores in 1 application. It's very impressive. However they have no API to allow a integrate 3rd party like myself to pursue this idea.

Walmart also have an API offering, but it's more for their online marketplace of vendors & drop shippers.

Amazon Fresh is an interesting competitor, but they're not as widespread. At the time of writing they're not even available in Cleveland. And as far as I can tell there's no public API either.

## So it already exists, kind of

As I'm writing this, I've found that a select few receipe sites have integrated in a similar way: https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/12/instacart-and-allrecipes-now-let-you-add-a-meals-ingredients-to-your-grocery-list-with-a-click/

So this concept has been around, but in a private deal between Instacart/Amazon Fresh & the very large receipe blogs.

I hope that this functionality is opened up to allow smaller food blogs to incorporate this new integration. It seems like a win-win-win for everyone. Everyone except Blue Apron and their competitors.
