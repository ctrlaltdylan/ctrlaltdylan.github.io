[Shopify Devs](https://twitter.com/shopifydevs) sent me a package of swag, and I feel like I must reciprocate as best I can.

This is the story of how I finally built and shipped my first actual revenue generating app.

The year was 2020, a dark and infamous year of course; but simultaneously a golden age of side projects. I was a dad to be and with faced with a lot of time to think about the future.

## The small, teeny tiny motivation

I had always wanted to build a small project that actually generated revenue. I knew I could either spend my off time playing a ton of videos games, or I could focus and actually ship something. 

Before this I didn't have constraints, I just had irregular free time without a real goal.

I would fail to build the MVP (bad), or fail to find a market (worse). Either way it was hours wasted.

I knew I didn't have a large window (9 months) and still working full time.

I needed to leverage an existing market and build something folks needed, and focus on using my dev skills to build something to easily plug and play. 

And I knew I had to take advantage of what was in front of me:

Time. 

Lots. And lots. Of uninterrupted socially distanced time.

## Micro apps can grow a large fund

I also didn't need the app to earn a ton of money. I could contribute up to $4,000 per year to max out tax free contributions [individual Ohio 529 plan](https://www.collegeadvantage.com/learn).

```
$4,000 / 12 months = ~$333
$333 / $10 per merchant = ~34 subscribing merchants
```

By focusing on a small goal, for once I was able to ship and deliver a small revenue generating app.

$333 per month at a %6 growth rate without taxation for 18 years will grow to around $153,225. At $10 per subscription, I just needed 34 subscribers to reach my 529 contribution goal.

It's not a crushing goal of trying to replace a full time job, but at the same time it's a meaningful amount of money given enough time.

## Enter Shopify Apps

I'm half ok at building stuff, especially extending existing systems. Give me a set of API documentation and I can figure it out.

But I wasn't then and I am still not an eCommerce merchant.

Because of my limited timeline and limited goal, I swallowed my pride and made an app for an exisiting category that I thought was totally oversaturated with solid high review apps.

After all, I only needed to capture a small part of the market to reach my goal. Why take a big swing where a ball _might_ be an instead take a stab a pie you know is there?

## I _can_ compete?

This ended up being a great decision. My entire devtrepreneur experience, I had been trying to swing for home runs each at bat.

I would whiff, but extremely slowly and with great effort.

I shipped the MVP of my app in a few weeks, and it was approved in another two weeks.

I was live, and much to my surprise I was getting a small trickle of installs - even subscriptions ðŸ˜®

## Small differentiators matter

My little app never will overthrow my well entrenched competitors. They will always outrank me in the SEO & Shopify App Store rankings.

But that doesn't mean you can't find a market with 2nd, 3rd, or 4th place.

My app was never top 10, but it resonated with a few merchants that had similar values that I tried to strive for in my app:

1. No Shopify app should ever need to alter your theme code
2. Don't make me think
3. You shouldn't feel like you're in an app. [Use Shopify's design system.](https://polaris.shopify.com/)

Following a set of rules gave me a similar but different app than my competitors, which was enough to make me and my awesome customers happy.

## Did you reach your goal?

Yes, 4 months after launch ðŸŽ¯

Thanks to feedback and asking questions as much as I could, I found a set of must have features that others weren't supporting, and did my best to deliver.

## Finding your motivation

2020 was a great year for side projects - some picked up frisbee golf, some ran [indoor marathons](https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/4/3/coronavirus-running-marathons-under-lockdown), some bought out [entire shelves of toliet paper](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/coronavirus-toilet-paper-shortage-panic/2020/04/07/1fd30e92-75b5-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html), and others tried to start businesses.

Looking back, sure the pandemic had an influence on my first profit generating app. But several other internal & external factors had played a part:

1. I had a small yet _possible_ goal
2. I had a clear MVP objective by looking at competing apps
3. I had quite a bit of free time
4. Building on an established platform allowed me to focus on just building

### 5. They send you awesome swag!

So long story short, like Sublime Text 2 I will ride out my micro app until it dies. But until then I'm just glad knowing that I built something that will widen my son's horizons just a little, or at least give him more options.
