    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I design, implement, test, and evaluate technology solutions. I have been building full stack applications for personal and professional projects since 2014. But a tinkerer and computer enthusiast since 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've learned several high level languages such has Ruby, Python, PHP, Javascript (and Node), SQL, etc. I don't particularly specialize in one area. I love learning and trying new and old technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end I am a problem solver, not a programmer. I seek to automate tasks and give my customers super powers to enrich their lives.
