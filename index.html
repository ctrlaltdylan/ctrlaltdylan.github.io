    Hello, I'm Dylan. Welcome to my little slice of the internet.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm known on the web for being the first to bring the concept of building your own <a href="http://blog.dylanjpierce.com/raspberrypi/magicmirror/tutorial/2015/12/27/build-a-magic-mirror.html">Smart Mirror</a> to the mainstream.
  </p>
  <p>
    Soon thereafter my lovely fiance and I built our tiny home. It took us a year of nights and weekends, but it's our full time home.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we travel full time. We hop from place to place every 3 months. Amy works as a traveling nurse, and I work remotely as a Software Engineer.

    Below are my random musings and projects:

  <h2 class="page-heading">Posts</h2>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
