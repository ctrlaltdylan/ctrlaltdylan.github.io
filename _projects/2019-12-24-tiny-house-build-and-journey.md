In the summer of 2016, my wife & I build our own tiny house on wheels and travelled across the country in it for 2 years while working full time jobs. We lived and played in places like Georgia, Florida, Montana & Washington. The best time of our lives.

It tooks us a full year of nights and weekends to build out the tiny house on wheels. 

Neither of us had any construction background or experience. We started with a shell from Liberation Tiny Homes & learned from YouTube videos & blogs about how to rough in windows, plumbing, electric, roofing, siding, flooring, cabintery, the whole thing.

It was one of the most difficult but also one of the most rewarding times of our lives. Then we travelled the country in it full time. My wife was a travelling nurse and I worked remotely.

We had the opportunity to live in beautiful places, meet great people I'm so lucky to call friends and learned about different cultures & history of the different areas of the United States.

I'm so fortunate to have had this opportunity with my significant other, that our interests and career paths allowed us to take this path less travelled. It's an experience I wish everyone could do.
