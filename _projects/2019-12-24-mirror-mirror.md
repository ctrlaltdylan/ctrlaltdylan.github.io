subtitle: America's first DIY Smart Mirror.
---

MirrorMirror was one of the first smart mirror builds. It featured a 2 way mirror that hid a full display of "widgets". It showed things like a daily compliment to my wife like: "You look especially amazing today".

It also included things like the weather, a Twitter feed, and commute conditions.

It was all intended to be just a Christmas present. After I gave her the mirror, I posted the [tutorial](/raspberrypi/magicmirror/tutorial/2015/12/27/build-a-magic-mirror.html) on [/r/DIY](https://reddit.com/r/DIY) and it went viral.

It was featured on a number of publications worldwide and lead to some fantastic opportunities.
