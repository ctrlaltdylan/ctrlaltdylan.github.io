subtitle: Learn Ruby syntax & concepts from rhyming PHP examples.
excerpt: |
  Learn Ruby efficently and quickly from PHP concepts you already understand. This e-course is a collection of all of the lessons that I wish someone would have shared with me while I was transitioning from PHP & Laravel development to Ruby on Rails.

I'm super proud to annouce I've completed a project I've been working on for quite some time - [PHP to Ruby :: Learn Ruby through PHP Examples](https://phptoruby.io).

PHP to Ruby is a short list of 40 some posts that will teach you the basics to the Ruby language for developers like me that came from a PHP background.

I was a PHP developer for a long time. I started with Symfony 2 and Laravel. Eventually I was decent enough at it to make a profession of it starting while I was in college. I even was a freelancer for a few years and was able to support myself through all kinds of client work.

Over the past year and a half I've switched over to Ruby and primarily Ruby on Rails. Which has been a zen-like development experience. 

You know when you take a drink of water after a long time and you didn't even realize how dehyrdated you were? That's kind of what writing Ruby is like after years of PHP - when you get the hang of it.


It was a frustrating experience at first because the syntax of Ruby was just plan _weird_ compared to what I knew. All of the books and tutorials I could find were geared towards programming beginners - I've written PHP production code! I kinda sorta know what I'm doing here!

So after my painful learning phase, I've decided to help you - the PHP developer - shortcut this entire process by writing a book that shows you the Ruby language concepts but with rhyming PHP examples along the way.

I hope it helps you. Check it out at [https://phptoruby.io](https://phptoruby.io)
